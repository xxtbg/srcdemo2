Made by <a href='http://steamcommunity.com/id/WindPower'>Etienne Perot</a>.

Utility to render high-quality, smooth Source Engine movies using a customized userspace filesystem that catches the frames before they are written to disk. Can render your movie at a framerate as high as you want it to be, yet keep disk usage flat. Adds a nice motion blur effect to the video. Also includes shutter angle simulation.

Can be used with any Source engine game with Source Recorder, which includes:
  * Team Fortress 2
  * Team Fortress 2 Beta
  * Portal
  * Portal 2
  * Counter-Strike Source
  * Any mod of the above games
  * Future Valve titles, possibly
  * Works with Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, but those two games use a glitchy version of the Source engine, which causes severe graphical issues (zombies teleporting all over the place) when rendering at high framerates

Relies on the [Dokan](http://dokan-dev.net/en/) library.
